## Description

Sheltr is a React based mobile first app that allows users to find their next rescue dog. Using the Petfinder API, Sheltr will search for dogs in the area and display them in a list. Users can then swipe left or right to see more information about the dog. Users can also save a dog to their favorites list and view their saved dogs.
